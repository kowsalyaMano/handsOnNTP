    <h1>Why to Learn java Programming?</h1>
    <p title="para">
      Java is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great
      Software Engineer specially when they are working in Software Development
      Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Java
      Programming:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt id="reasons">Object Oriented</dt>
      <dd class="description01">
        In Java, everthing is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is
        based on the Object model.
      </dd>
      <dt id="reasons">Platform Independent</dt>
      <dd>
        Unlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java
        is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather
        into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over
        the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever
        platform it is being run on.
      </dd>
      <dt id="reasons">Simple</dt>
      <dd>
        Java is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic
        concept of <em>OOP Java</em>, it would be easy to master.
      </dd>
      <dt id="reasons">Secure</dt>
      <dd>
        With Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free
        systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.
      </dd>
      <dt id="reasons">Architecture-neutral</dt>
      <dd>
        Java complier generates an architecture-neutal object file format, which
        makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence
        of Java runtime system.
      </dd>
      <dt id="reasons">Portable</dt>
      <dd>
        Being architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent
        aspects of the specification makes Java portable.
        <em>Complier in Java is written in ANSI C</em> with a clean protability
        boundary, which is a POSIX subset.
      </dd>
      <dt id="reasons">Robust</dt>
      <dd class="description07">
        Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing
        mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.
      </dd>
