        HTML which gives the structure to the webpage. While learning, it was
        entertaing to create my own webpages. Unlike other programming
        languages, HTML is far easier to understand and learn. One does not
        require a computer science degree to understand it. Simply the basic
        knowledge of the web will suffice. Though you cannot learn it in one
        day, even if you spend a few days to learn the basics of HTML, you will
        be able to make your unique web page.
