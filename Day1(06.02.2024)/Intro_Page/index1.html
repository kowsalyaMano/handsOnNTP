    <p>
      Learning to code can be frustrating and one needs to put in time, effort
      and determination. At the same time it can be really fulfilling if
      solutions for problems are found and new or rebuilt sites turns out
      looking cool. For me practicing with coding was useful because now I have
      a better idea of a developerâ€™s job. This will make future conversations
      with developers easier and more efficient. This is good for a UX designer
      and can only be positive for the relationships between designer and
      developer.
